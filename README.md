# Generic Data Encryption Module

## Overview

The **Generic Data Encryption Module** is a versatile project designed to provide robust cryptographic services to ensure data confidentiality and integrity. This module implements various encryption techniques, including symmetric and asymmetric encryption, and hashing functions. It is developed as a set of services and libraries that can be integrated with other systems and microservices.

## Features

- **Symmetric Encryption**: Uses AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) for secure data encryption.
- **Asymmetric Encryption**: Implements RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) for secure key exchange.
- **Hashing**: Provides hashing functions like SHA-256 for data integrity.
- **Key Management**: Secure key generation, storage, and management.
- **Integration**: Easily integrates with other systems and microservices.
- **Design Patterns**: Applies design patterns to enhance security and maintainability.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **OpenSSL**: Ensure that the OpenSSL library is installed on your system. You can download it from [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/generic-data-encryption-module.git
